## Dataset Overview: MIMIC-IV

MediAssist is built using the **MIMIC-IV dataset**, a publicly available database containing comprehensive de-identified clinical data from real hospital encounters. It includes:

- **Patient Demographics**: Age, gender, ethnicity, and admission types.
- **Diagnoses**: Standardized ICD codes for medical conditions and procedures.
- **Medications**: Details of prescriptions, dosages, and administration schedules.
- **Clinical Notes**: Free-text notes summarizing patient outcomes, treatments, and discharge instructions.
- **Vital Signs and Lab Results**: Captures real-time measurements and lab test outcomes.

**Key Highlights**:
- Hosts over **40 million observations** from critical care units.
- Structured and unstructured data enable diverse use cases, such as summarization, risk analysis, and coding.
- Requires institutional approval for access via [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/3.1/).

## Example Usage

### **1. Patient History Summarization**
- **Input**: "Summarize the health history for patient ID 12345."
- **Output**:
  ```
  Patient admitted on 2023-10-01 for hypertension management.
  Medications: Lisinopril (10 mg daily).
  Discharge Summary: Stable vitals, discharged on 2023-11-01 with recommendations for dietary changes and regular follow-ups.
  ```

### **2. Medical Coding Automation**
- **Input**: "Assign ICD codes to the following discharge note: 'Patient diagnosed with essential hypertension and Type 2 diabetes.'"
- **Output**:
  ```
  ICD Codes:
  - I10: Essential Hypertension
  - E11.9: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Without Complications
  ```

### **3. Patient Risk Stratification**
- **Input**: "What is the risk level for patient ID 7890?"
- **Output**:
  ```
  Risk Level: High
  Contributing Factors:
  - Multiple admissions for congestive heart failure.
  - Comorbidities include chronic kidney disease (stage 3).
  - Recent lab results indicate elevated creatinine levels.
  ```

### **4. RAG Query for Clinical Data Retrieval**
- **Input**: "Retrieve recent lab results and vital signs for patient ID 56789."
- **Output**:
  ```
  Latest Lab Results:
  - Hemoglobin A1c: 7.2%
  - White Blood Cell Count: 8.1 K/ÂµL
  Recent Vital Signs:
  - Blood Pressure: 140/90 mmHg
  - Heart Rate: 78 bpm
  ```

## Challenges and Solutions

### Data-Related Challenges

1. **Missing Data**:
   - **Challenge**: Significant missingness in critical fields like `deathtime` and `discharge_location` posed difficulties for analysis and model training.
   - **Solution**: Null values were imputed using dbt transformations. For example, missing dates were replaced with placeholders like `1900-01-01 00:00:00`, and categorical fields were standardized with `N/A`. Incomplete records were flagged to mitigate potential biases during downstream processing.

2. **High Variability in Clinical Text**:
   - **Challenge**: Discharge summaries and clinical notes exhibited unstructured formats with inconsistent terminology.
   - **Solution**: Advanced NLP techniques were employed for preprocessing, including domain-specific tokenizers tailored for medical abbreviations and terminology, ensuring better standardization and model compatibility.

3. **Imbalanced Data for Risk Stratification**:
   - **Challenge**: High-risk patient cases were underrepresented in the dataset, leading to skewed model predictions.
   - **Solution**: Data augmentation techniques, such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling), were applied to balance the dataset. Additionally, weighted training processes were introduced to ensure the model focused on underrepresented high-risk cases.

### Technical Challenges

1. **Text Parsing Errors**:
   - **Challenge**: Multiline text fields in the Discharge table caused parsing failures during ETL processes.
   - **Solution**: Parsing settings were adjusted to handle multiline text efficiently. Validation checks were also added to ensure no critical data was lost during ingestion.

2. **Memory Constraints in Large Tables**:
   - **Challenge**: Large data volumes, especially from the Pharmacy table, caused memory errors during ingestion.
   - **Solution**: Data ingestion was optimized by splitting large tables into smaller chunks. Efficient indexing and data partitioning were implemented to reduce memory usage.

3. **Schema Inference Issues**:
   - **Challenge**: Inconsistent schema inference during Snowpark ingestion led to data type mismatches (e.g., string fields recognized instead of dates).
   - **Solution**: Schema corrections were manually performed, and dbt transformations ensured consistent data types across tables to eliminate errors.
