# MediAssist: AI-Driven Patient Health History Chatbot with Advanced Clinical Capabilities

Welcome to **MediAssist**, an AI-powered chatbot designed to enhance clinical workflows by summarizing patient health histories, automating medical coding, stratifying patient risks, and providing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities for complex decision-making tasks. 

This repository contains all resources, documentation, and tools required to deploy and understand the MediAssist system.

## Features

- **Patient History Summarization**: Generate concise patient summaries from clinical records.
- **Medical Coding Automation**: Assign standardized ICD codes for diagnoses and procedures.
- **Patient Risk Stratification**: Categorize patients into risk levels based on clinical data.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Retrieve and generate contextual information to aid clinical decisions.

## Dataset Overview: MIMIC-IV

MediAssist is built using the **MIMIC-IV dataset**, a publicly available database containing comprehensive de-identified clinical data from real hospital encounters. It includes:

- **Patient Demographics**: Age, gender, ethnicity, and admission types.
- **Diagnoses**: Standardized ICD codes for medical conditions and procedures.
- **Medications**: Details of prescriptions, dosages, and administration schedules.
- **Clinical Notes**: Free-text notes summarizing patient outcomes, treatments, and discharge instructions.
- **Vital Signs and Lab Results**: Captures real-time measurements and lab test outcomes.

**Key Highlights**:
- Hosts over **40 million observations** from critical care units.
- Structured and unstructured data enable diverse use cases, such as summarization, risk analysis, and coding.
- Requires institutional approval for access via [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/3.1/).

## Example Usage

### **1. Patient History Summarization**
- **Input**: "Summarize the health history for patient ID 12345."
- **Output**:
  ```
  Patient admitted on 2023-10-01 for hypertension management.
  Medications: Lisinopril (10 mg daily).
  Discharge Summary: Stable vitals, discharged on 2023-11-01 with recommendations for dietary changes and regular follow-ups.
  ```

### **2. Medical Coding Automation**
- **Input**: "Assign ICD codes to the following discharge note: 'Patient diagnosed with essential hypertension and Type 2 diabetes.'"
- **Output**:
  ```
  ICD Codes:
  - I10: Essential Hypertension
  - E11.9: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Without Complications
  ```

### **3. Patient Risk Stratification**
- **Input**: "What is the risk level for patient ID 7890?"
- **Output**:
  ```
  Risk Level: High
  Contributing Factors:
  - Multiple admissions for congestive heart failure.
  - Comorbidities include chronic kidney disease (stage 3).
  - Recent lab results indicate elevated creatinine levels.
  ```

### **4. RAG Query for Clinical Data Retrieval**
- **Input**: "Retrieve recent lab results and vital signs for patient ID 56789."
- **Output**:
  ```
  Latest Lab Results:
  - Hemoglobin A1c: 7.2%
  - White Blood Cell Count: 8.1 K/ÂµL
  Recent Vital Signs:
  - Blood Pressure: 140/90 mmHg
  - Heart Rate: 78 bpm
  ```
